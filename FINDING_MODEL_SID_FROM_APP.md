# Finding Model SID from Matterport App - Step by Step

## Based on Your App Screenshots

I can see your scan "101 Massachusetts Ave" is complete! Here's how to get the Model SID:

## Method 1: Share Link (Easiest from App)

### Steps:

1. **In the Matterport App:**
   - You're viewing "101 Massachusetts Ave"
   - Look for a **"Share"** button (usually in the top bar or bottom menu)
   - OR tap the three-dot menu (⋮) you see - look for "Share" option

2. **Get Share Link:**
   - Tap "Share" 
   - Choose "Copy Link" or "Get Link"
   - The link will look like:
     ```
     https://my.matterport.com/showcase/?m=YOUR_MODEL_SID_HERE
     ```

3. **Extract Model SID:**
   - Copy the entire link
   - The Model SID is the part after `?m=`
   - Example: If link is `https://my.matterport.com/showcase/?m=abc123xyz456`
   - Your Model SID is: `abc123xyz456`

## Method 2: From Scan Details (If Available)

### Steps:

1. **Tap the three-dot menu (⋮)** on your scan
2. **Look for:**
   - "Details" or "Info" option
   - "View in Browser" option
   - "Settings" option

3. **If you see "View in Browser" or "Details":**
   - Tap it
   - This opens the scan in web browser
   - The URL will contain the Model SID

## Method 3: Web Dashboard (Most Reliable)

Since the app menu doesn't always show the SID directly:

1. **Open Web Browser:**
   - Go to: https://my.matterport.com
   - Log in with your Matterport account

2. **Find Your Scan:**
   - Click "Spaces" in left sidebar
   - Find "101 Massachusetts Ave"

3. **Get Model SID:**
   - Click on the scan to open it
   - Look at the browser URL
   - It will be: `https://my.matterport.com/showcase/?m=YOUR_MODEL_SID`
   - Copy the part after `?m=`

## Method 4: From Bottom Navigation

Looking at your screenshot, I see bottom navigation icons. Try:

1. **Tap the scan thumbnail** (the image of the room)
2. **Look for:**
   - Share icon (usually in top bar)
   - Info icon
   - Settings icon

3. **If you see a share icon:**
   - Tap it
   - Copy the link
   - Extract Model SID from URL

   - Check the URL bar
   - Model SID will be in the URL

   - The share link contains the SID

## Recommended: Use Web Dashboard

**Fastest Method:**

1. Open: https://my.matterport.com
2. Login
3. Click "Spaces" → "101 Massachusetts Ave"
4. URL shows: `?m=YOUR_MODEL_SID`

This is the most reliable way since the Model SID is always in the URL.

4. **Paste the Model SID**
5. **Click "Extract Measurements"**

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see Share option"
- Try tapping the scan thumbnail to open the full viewer
- Share option is usually in the viewer, not the list
- Use web dashboard instead

### "I can't find Details/Info"
- Not all app versions show this
- Use web dashboard - it's more reliable
- Or use the Share link method

### "The URL doesn't show ?m="
- Make sure you're viewing the scan, not the spaces list
- Try clicking "View in Browser" if available
- Use web dashboard directly

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Scan is complete (✅ You have this)
- [ ] Found Share option OR opened web dashboard
- [ ] Got the share link or URL
- [ ] Extracted Model SID (part after `?m=`)
- [ ] Ready to paste in your app!

**Pro Tip:** The web dashboard (my.matterport.com) is the most reliable way to get the Model SID - it's always visible in the URL when viewing a scan!
